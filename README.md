# scatteringLab-IFS
Scripts used in the scattering lab of IFS. Massey.

Build correlator c code to control correlator:
Reccomendations:
cd build/correlator
cmake ../../src/correlator -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64"

Open VS (The community version is always free)
Import the project generated by cmake and build it.
This generates an executable.

We have a python script that "call" the generated output.
We chose python for easy development,
but you can also create your own c file with the same 
options (rename of file in terms of input angle) than the
python script.
